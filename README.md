FooTools
========

Quickie set of essential tools for .NET developers

Objectives
==========

1. To create a library for .NETters to use a minimal set of tools to assist them in building their business logic.
2. The library may be minimal (some say simplistic), but it will be sufficient to 'get the job done'.
3. The library will be Mono friendly - who needs Windows to do .NET magic?

Desired Tools
=============
1. RDBMS SQL query
2. Logging (is it really needed when Log4N is so popular?)
3. Config read-write
