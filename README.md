Quickie set of essential tools for .NET developers

Objectives
----------

1. To create a library for .NETters to use a minimal set of tools to assist them in building their business logic.
2. The library may be minimal (some say simplistic), but it will be sufficient to 'get the job done'.
3. The library will be Mono friendly - who needs Windows to do .NET magic?

Current Status
--------------
1. Basic tools are available and functional.
2. Not considered matured. Use with care.

Key Tools
-------------
1. RDBMS SQL query
2. Logging (is it really needed when Log4N is so popular?)
3. Config read-write
4. Http client for basic GET/ POST needs. Removes the dependency for .NET 4.5


Development Framework
---------------------
1. This is developed on Visual Studio Express 2010
2. Target framework is 4.0. I don't see why it can't be done on 3.5, but it's for my own learning that I'm moving forward to 4.0. Sorry.
